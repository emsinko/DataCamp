Understanding that git works with the changes, not the files.

Git concentrates on the changes to a file, not the file itself. A git add file command does not tell git to add the file to the repository, but to note the current state of the file for it to be commited later.




We will try to investigate the difference in this lesson.

git init initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control.

git clone creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project’s files, history, and branches.

git add stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project’s history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project’s history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.

git commit saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit.

git status shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

git branch shows the branches being worked on locally.

git merge merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the master branch for deployment.

git pull updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.

git push updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
------------------

-- CHAPTER 1 --
---------------


When you are using Git, you will frequently want to check the status of your repository. To do this, run the command git status, which displays a list of the files that have been modified since the last time changes were saved.

You have been put in the dental repository. Use git status to discover which file(s) have been changed since the last save. Which file(s) are listed?

How can I tell what I have changed?
Git has a staging area in which it stores files with changes you want to save that haven't been saved yet. 
Putting files in the staging area is like putting things in a box, while committing those changes is like putting that box in the mail: you can add more things to the box or take things out as often as you want, but once you put it in the mail, you can't make further changes.

git status shows you which files are in this staging area, and which files have changes that haven't yet been put there. 
In order to compare the file as it currently is to what you last saved, you can use git diff filename. 
git diff without any filenames will show you all the changes in your repository, while git diff directory will show you the changes to the files in some directory.


What is in a diff?
A diff is a formatted display of the differences between two sets of files. Git displays diffs like this:

diff --git a/report.txt b/report.txt
index e713b17..4c0742a 100644
--- a/report.txt
+++ b/report.txt
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-# Seasonal Dental Surgeries 2017-18
+# Seasonal Dental Surgeries (2017) 2017-18

 TODO: write executive summary.


This shows:

The command used to produce the output (in this case, diff --git). In it, a and b are placeholders meaning "the first version" and "the second version".
An index line showing keys into Git's internal database of changes. We will explore these in the next chapter.
--- a/report.txt and +++ b/report.txt, which indicate that lines being removed are prefixed with -, while lines being added are prefixed with +.
A line starting with @@ that tells where the changes are being made. The pairs of numbers are start line,number of lines changed. Here, the diff output shows that 4 lines from line 1 are being removed and replaced with new lines.
A line-by-line listing of the changes with - showing deletions and + showing additions. (We have also configured Git to show deletions in red and additions in green.) Lines that haven't changed are sometimes shown before and after the ones that have in order to give context; when they appear, they don't have either + or - in front of them.

Desktop programming tools like RStudio can turn diffs like this into a more readable side-by-side display of changes; you can also use standalone tools like DiffMerge or WinMerge.

------

What's the first step in saving changes?
You commit changes to a Git repository in two steps:

Add one or more files to the staging area.
Commit everything in the staging area.
To add a file to the staging area, use git add filename.

You have been put in the dental repository. Use git add to add the file report.txt to the staging area.
Use another Git command to check the repository's status.

------

How can I tell what's going to be committed?
To compare the state of your files with those in the staging area, you can use git diff -r HEAD. The -r flag means "compare to a particular revision", and HEAD is a shortcut meaning "the most recent commit".

You can restrict the results to a single file or directory using git diff -r HEAD path/to/file, where the path to the file is relative to where you are (for example, the path from the root directory of the repository).

We will explore other uses of -r and HEAD in the next chapter.

-------

Interlude: how can I edit a file?
Unix has a bewildering variety of text editors. In this course, we will sometimes use a very simple one called Nano. If you type nano filename, it will open filename for editing (or create it if it doesn't already exist). You can then move around with the arrow keys, delete characters with the backspace key, and so on. You can also do a few other operations with control-key combinations:

Ctrl-K: delete a line.
Ctrl-U: un-delete a line.
Ctrl-O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output').
Ctrl-X: exit the editor.


Run nano names.txt to edit a new file in your home directory and enter the following four lines:

Lovelace
Hopper
Johnson
Wilson
To save what you have written, type Ctrl-O to write the file out, then Enter to confirm the filename, then Ctrl-X and Enter to exit the editor.

--------

How do I commit changes?
To save the changes in the staging area, you use the command git commit. It always saves everything that is in the staging area as one unit: as you will see later, when you want to undo changes to a project, you undo all of a commit or none of it.

When you commit changes, Git requires you to enter a log message. This serves the same purpose as a comment in a program: it tells the next person to examine the repository why you made a change.

By default, Git launches a text editor to let you write this message. To keep things simple, you can use -m "some message in quotes" on the command line to enter a single-line message like this:

git commit -m "Program appears to have become self-aware."

If you accidentally mistype a commit message, you can change it using the --amend flag.

git commit --amend - m "new message"

EX: You have been put in the dental repository, and report.txt has been added to the staging area. Use a Git command to check the status of the repository.

$ cd dental
$ git add report.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   report.txt

EX: Commit the changes in the staging area with the message "Adding a reference."
$ git commit -m "Adding a reference"

----------

How can I view a repository's history?
The command git log is used to view the log of the project's history. Log entries are shown most recent first, and look like this:

commit 0430705487381195993bac9c21512ccfb511056d
Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 20 13:42:26 2017 +0000

    Added year to report title.
The commit line displays a unique ID for the commit called a hash; we will explore these further in the next chapter. The other lines tell you who made the change, when, and what log message they wrote for the change.

When you run git log, Git automatically uses a pager to show one screen of output at a time. Press the space bar to go down a page or the 'q' key to quit.

You are in the directory dental, which is a Git repository. Use a single Git command to view the repository's history. What is the message on the very first entry in the log (which is displayed last)?		

----------

How can I view a specific file's history?	

git log path/to/file

----------

How do I write a better log message?
Writing a one-line log message with git commit -m "message"is good enough for very small changes, but your collaborators (including your future self) 
will appreciate more information. If you run git commit without -m "message", Git launches a text editor with a template like this:

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   skynet.R
#

The lines starting with # are comments, and won't be saved. 
(They are there to remind you what you are supposed to do and what files you have changed.) 
Your message should go at the top, and may be as long and as detailed as you want.

-----------

Neat! This concludes chapter 1, where you learned about git diff, git status, git add and git commit. Quite something! Rush over to chapter 2 to continue your Git adventure!

-----------

---------------
-- CHAPTER 2 --
---------------

How does Git store information?
You may wonder what information is stored by each commit that you make. Git uses a three-level structure for this.

1) A commit contains metadata such as the author, the commit message, and the time the commit happened. In the diagram below, the most recent commit is at the bottom (feed0098), and vertical arrows point up towards the previous ("parent") commits.

2) Each commit also has a tree, which tracks the names and locations in the repository when that commit happened. In the oldest (top) commit, there were two files tracked by the repository.

3) For each of the files listed in the tree, there is a blob. This contains a compressed snapshot of the contents of the file when the commit happened. 
(Blob is short for binary large object, which is a SQL database term for "may contain data of any kind".) In the middle commit, report.md and draft.md were changed, so the 
blobs are shown next to that commit. data/northern.csv didn't change in that commit, so the tree links to the blob from the previous commit. 
Reusing blobs between commits help make common operations fast and minimizes storage space.


-----------

Every commit to a repository has a unique identifier called a hash (since it is generated by running the changes through a pseudo-random number generator called a hash function). This hash is normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string like 7c35a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93, but most of the time, you only have to give Git the first 6 or 8 characters in order to identify the commit you mean.

Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories. If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same. Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well. Git can therefore tell what information needs to be saved where by comparing hashes rather than comparing entire files.

-----------

Exercise
Exercise
How can I view a specific commit?
To view the details of a specific commit, you use the command git show with the first few characters of the commit's hash. For example, the command git show 0da2f7 produces this:

commit 0da2f7ad11664ca9ed933c1ccd1f3cd24d481e42
Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>

    Added year to report title.

diff --git a/report.txt b/report.txt

+++ b/report.txt
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-# Seasonal Dental Surgeries 2017-18
+# Seasonal Dental Surgeries (2017) 2017-18

 TODO: write executive summary.
The first part is the same as the log entry shown by git log. 
The second part shows the changes; as with git diff, lines that the change removed are prefixed with -, while lines that it added are prefixed with +.


You have been put in the dental directory. Use git log to see the hashes of recent commits, and then git show with the first few digits of a hash to look at the most recent commit. How many files did it change?
Reminder: press the space bar to page down through git log's output and q to quit the paged display.

------------

What is Git's equivalent of a relative path?
A hash is like an absolute path: it identifies a specific commit. Another way to identify a commit is to use the equivalent of a relative path. The special label HEAD, which we saw in the previous chapter, always refers to the most recent commit. The label HEAD~1 then refers to the commit before it, while HEAD~2 refers to the commit before that, and so on.

Note that the symbol between HEAD and the number is a tilde ~, not a minus sign -, and that there cannot be spaces before or after the tilde.

You are in the dental repository. Using a single Git command, show the commit made just before the most recent one. Which of the following files did it change?

------------

How can I see who changed what in a file?
git log displays the overall history of a project or file, but Git can give even more information: the command git annotate file shows who made the last change to each line of a file and when. For example, the first three lines of output from git annotate report.txt look something like this:

04307054        (  Rep Loop     2017-09-20 13:42:26 +0000       1)# Seasonal Dental Surgeries (2017) 2017-18
5e6f92b6        (  Rep Loop     2017-09-20 13:42:26 +0000       2)

Each line contains five things, with two to four in parentheses.
In this example, there are only 2 distinct commits, for second one, there are 2 "changes"


The first eight digits of the hash, 04307054.
The author, Rep Loop.
The time of the commit, 2017-09-20 13:42:26 +0000.
The line number, 1.
The contents of the line, # Seasonal Dental Surgeries (2017) 2017-18.
You are in the dental repository. Use a single command to see the changes to report.txt. How many different sets of changes have been made to this file (i.e., how many different hashes show up in the first column of the output)?

------------

How can I see what changed between two commits?
git show with a commit ID shows the changes made in a particular commit. 
To see the changes between two commits, you can use git diff ID1..ID2, where ID1 and ID2 identify the two commits you're interested in, and the connector .. is a pair of dots. 
For example, git diff abc123..def456 shows the differences between the commits abc123 and def456, while git diff HEAD~1..HEAD~3 shows the differences between the state of 
the repository one commit in the past and its state three commits in the past.

You are in the dental repository. Use git diff to view the differences between its current state and its state two commits previously. 
Which of the following files have changed?

ANSWER: git diff HEAD..HEAD~2

-------------

ow do I add new files?H
Git does not track files by default. Instead, it waits until you have used git add at least once before it starts paying attention to a file.

In the diagram you saw at the start of the chapter, the untracked files won't have a blob, and won't be listed in a tree.

The untracked files won't benefit from version control, so to make sure you don't miss anything, git status will always tell you about files that are in your repository but aren't (yet) being tracked.

$ cd dental
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        sources.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
$ git add sources.txt
$ git commit
[master 16b06a6] Starting to track data sources
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 sources.txt
 
------------

How do I tell Git to ignore certain files?
Data analysis often produces temporary or intermediate files that you don't want to save. You can tell it to stop paying attention to files you don't care about by creating a file in the root directory of your repository called .gitignore and storing a list of wildcard patterns that specify the files you don't want Git to pay attention to. For example, if .gitignore contains:

build
*.mpl
then Git will ignore any file or directory called build (and, if it's a directory, anything in it), as well as any file whose name ends in .mpl.

Which of the following files would not be ignored by a .gitignore that contained the lines:

pdf
*.pyc
backup

Possible Answers:

report.pdf  --> THIS 
bin/analyze.pyc
backup/northern.csv
None of the above.

-------------

How can I remove unwanted files?
Git can help you clean up files that you have told it you don't want. The command git clean -n will show you a list of files that are in the repository, but whose history Git is not currently tracking. A similar command git clean -f will then delete those files.

Use this command carefully: git clean only works on untracked files, so by definition, their history has not been saved. If you delete them with git clean -f, they're gone for good.

You are in the dental repository. Use git status to see the status of your repo.
backup.log appears to be an untracked file and it's one we don't need. Let's get rid of it. Use git clean with the appropriate flag to remove unwanted files.
List the files in your directory. backup.log should no longer be there! 

$ cd dental
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        backup.log

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
$ git clean
fatal: clean.requireForce defaults to true and neither -i, -n, nor -f given; refusing to clean
$ ls
backup.log  bin  data  report.txt  results

--------------

How can I see how Git is configured?
Like most complex pieces of software, Git allows you to change its default settings. To see what the settings are, you can use the command git config --list with one of three additional options:

--system: settings for every user on this computer.
--global: settings for every one of your projects.
--local: settings for one specific project.
Each level overrides the one above it, so local settings (per-project) take precedence over global settings (per-user), which in turn take precedence over system settings (for all users on the computer).

You are in the dental repository. How many local configuration values are set in for this repository?

$ git config --list
user.email=repl@datacamp.com
user.name=Rep Loop
core.editor=nano
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
$ git config --list --local
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true

---------------

How can I change my Git configuration?
Most of Git's settings should be left as they are. However, there are two you should set on every computer you use: your name and your email address. These are recorded in the log every time you commit a change, and are often used to identify the authors of a project's content in order to give credit (or assign blame, depending on the circumstances).

To change a configuration value for all of your projects on a particular computer, run the command:

git config --global setting.name setting.value
with the setting's name and value in the appropriate places.
The keys that identify your name and email address are user.name and user.email respectively.


Change the email address (user.email) configured for the current user for all projects to rep.loop@datacamp.com:  
Solution: git config --global user.email rep.loop@datacamp.com

-- CHAPTER 3 --
---------------

How can I commit changes selectively?
You don't have to put all of the changes you have made recently into the staging area at once. For example, suppose you are adding a feature to analysis.R and spot a bug in cleanup.R. After you have fixed it, you want to save your work. Since the changes to cleanup.R aren't directly related to the work you're doing in analysis.R, you should save your work in two separate commits.

The syntax for staging a single file is git add path/to/file.

If you make a mistake and accidentally stage a file you shouldn't have, you can unstage the additions with git reset HEAD and try again.

$ cd dental
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   data/eastern.csv
        modified:   data/northern.csv

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add data/northern.csv
$ git commit
[master d662ae2] Adding data from northern region.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 
------------
 How do I re-stage files?

People often save their work every few minutes when they're using a desktop text editor. 
Similarly, it's common to use git add periodically to save the most recent changes to a file to the staging area. 
This is particularly useful when the changes are experimental and you might want to undo them without cluttering up the repository's history.

You are in the dental repository. Use git status to check the status of the repository.

------------

How can I undo changes to unstaged files?
Suppose you have made changes to a file, then decide you want to undo them. Your text editor may be able to do this, but a more reliable way is to let Git do the work. The command:

git checkout -- filename
will discard the changes that have not yet been staged. (The double dash -- must be there to separate the git checkout command from the names of the file or files you want to recover.)

Use this command carefully: once you discard changes in this way, they are gone forever.

$ cd dental
$ git add data/*.csv
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   data/eastern.csv
        modified:   data/northern.csv

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   data/northern.csv

$ git checkout data/northern.csv
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   data/eastern.csv
        modified:   data/northern.csv
		
------------
		
How can I undo changes to staged files?
At the start of this chapter you saw that git reset will unstage files that you previously staged using git add. By combining git reset with git checkout, you can undo changes to a file that you staged changes to. The syntax is as follows.

git reset HEAD path/to/file
git checkout -- path/to/file
(You may be wondering why there are two commands for re-setting changes. 
The answer is that unstaging a file and undoing changes are both special cases of more powerful Git operations that you have not yet seen.)

-------------

How do I restore an old version of a file?
You previously saw how to use git checkout to undo the change that you made since the last commit. 
This command can also be used to go back even further into a file's history and restore versions of that file from a commit. 
In this way, you can think of committing as saving your work, and checking out as loading that saved version.

The syntax for restoring an old version takes two arguments: the hash that identifies the version you want to restore, and the name of the file.

For example, if git log shows this:

commit ab8883e8a6bfa873d44616a0f356125dbaccd9ea
Author: Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 19 09:37:48 2017 -0400

    Adding graph to show latest quarterly results.

commit 2242bd761bbeafb9fc82e33aa5dad966adfe5409
Author: Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 16 09:17:37 2017 -0400

    Modifying the bibliography format.
then git checkout 2242bd report.txt would replace the current version of report.txt with the version that was committed on October 16.   --> PRIKAZ
Notice that this is the same syntax that you used to undo the unstaged changes, except -- has been replaced by a hash.

Restoring a file doesn't erase any of the repository's history. Instead, the act of restoring the file is saved as another commit, because you might later want to undo your undoing.

One more thing: there's another feature of git log that will come in handy here. Passing - then a number restricts the output to that many commits. 
For example, git log -3 report.txt shows you the last three commits involving report.txt.

-------------

How can I undo all of the changes I have made?
So far, you have seen how to undo changes to a single file at a time using git reset HEAD path/to/file. You will sometimes want to undo changes to many files.

One way to do this is to give git reset a directory. For example, git reset HEAD data will unstage any files from the data directory. Even better, if you don't provide any files or directories, it will unstage everything. Even even better, HEAD is the default commit to unstage, so you can simply write git reset to unstage everything.

Similarly git checkout -- data will then restore the files in the data directory to their previous state. You can't leave the file argument completely blank, but recall from Introduction to Shell for Data Science that you can refer to the current directory as .. So git checkout -- . will revert all files in the current directory.

EX 1 : Use git reset to remove all files from the staging area.  .... git reset -- .
EX 2: Use git checkout to put those files back in their previous state. 
	  Use the directory name . to mean "all of the files in or below this directory", and separate it from the command with --
	  Solution: git checkout -- .

What is a branch?
If you don't use version control, a common workflow is to create different subdirectories to hold different versions of your project in different states, for example development and final. Of course, then you always end up with final-updated and final-updated-revised as well. The problem with this is that it becomes difficult to work out if you have the right version of each file in the right subdirectory, and you risk losing work.

One of the reasons Git is popular is its support for creating branches, which allows you to have multiple versions of your work, and lets you track each version systematically.

Each branch is like a parallel universe: changes you make in one branch do not affect other branches (until you merge them back together).

Note: Chapter 2 described the three-part data structure Git uses to record a repository's history: blobs for files, trees for the saved states of the repositories, and commits to record the changes. Branches are the reason Git needs both trees and commits: a commit will have two parents when branches are being merged.

----------------
How can I see what branches my repository has?
By default, every Git repository has a branch called master (which is why you have been seeing that word in Git's output in previous lessons). 
To list all of the branches in a repository, you can run the command git branch. 
The branch you are currently in will be shown with a * beside its name.

-----------------
How can I view the differences between branches?
Branches and revisions are closely connected, and commands that work on the latter usually work on the former. 
For example, just as git diff revision-1..revision-2 shows the difference between two versions of a repository, git diff branch-1..branch-2 shows the difference between two branches.

-----------------

How can I switch from one branch to another?
You previously used git checkout with a commit hash to switch the repository state to that hash. You can also use git checkout with the name of a branch to switch to that branch.

Two notes:

When you run git branch, it puts a * beside the name of the branch you are currently in.
Git will only let you do this if all of your changes have been committed. You can get around this, but it is outside the scope of this course.
In this exercise, you'll also make use of git rm. This removes the file (just like the shell command rm) then stages the removal of that file with git add, all in one step.

EX1: You are in the master branch of the dental repository. Switch to the summary-statistics branch... Solution: git checkout summary-statistics
EX2: Use git rm to remove report.txt... Solution:  git rm report.txt
EX3: Commit your change with `-m "Removing report" as a message.... Solution: git commit -m "Removing report"
EX4: Use ls to check that it's gone... Solution: ls
EX5: Switch back to master branch.. Solution: git checkout master

------------------

How can I create a branch?
You might expect that you would use git branch to create a branch, and indeed this is possible. However, the most common thing you want to do is to create a branch then switch to that branch.

In the previous exercise, you used git checkout branch-name to switch to a branch. To create a branch then switch to it in one step, you add a -b flag, calling git checkout -b branch-name,

The contents of the new branch are initially identical to the contents of the original. Once you start making changes, they only affect the new branch.

git checkout -b new_branch_name (flag -b create and switch to this branch)

------------
How can I merge two branches?
Branching lets you create parallel universes; merging is how you bring them back together. When you merge one branch (call it the source) into another (call it the destination), Git incorporates the changes made to the source branch into the destination branch. If those changes don't overlap, the result is a new commit in the destination branch that includes everything from the source branch. (The next exercises describes what happens if there are conflicts.)

To merge two branches, you run git merge source destination (without .. between the two branch names). Git automatically opens an editor so that you can write a log message for the merge; you can either keep its default message or fill in something more informative.	

EX1: You are in the master branch of the dental repository. Merge the changes fro m the summary-statistics branch (the source) into the master branch (the destination) with the message "Merging summary statistics."
SOLUTION : git merge summary-statistics master -m "Merging summary statistics"

------------

What are conflicts?
Sometimes the changes in two branches will conflict with each other: for example, bug fixes might touch the same lines of code, or analyses in two different branches may both append new (and different) records to a summary data file. In this case, Git relies on you to reconcile the conflicting changes.

The file todo.txt initially contains these two lines:

A) Write report.
B) Submit report.
You create a branch called update and modify the file to be:

A) Write report.
B) Submit final version.
C) Submit expenses.
You then switch back to the master branch and delete the first line, so that the file contains:

B) Submit report.
When you try to merge update and master, what conflicts does Git report?


Just line B, since it is the only one to change in both branches.

How can I create a brand new repository?   (GIT INIT name_or_repo) 

So far, you have been working with repositories that we created. 
If you want to create a repository for a new project, you can simply say git init project-name, where "project-name" is the name you want the new repository's root directory to have.

One thing you should not do is create one Git repository inside another. 
While Git does allow this, updating nested repositories becomes very complicated very quickly, since you need to tell Git which of the two .git directories the 
update is to be stored in. Very large projects occasionally need to do this, but most programmers and data analysts try to avoid getting into this situation.

--------------

How can I turn an existing project into a Git repository?
Experienced Git users instinctively start new projects by creating repositories. If you are new to Git, though, or working with people who are, you will often want to convert existing projects into repositories. Doing so is simple: just run

git init
in the project's root directory, or

git init /path/to/project
from anywhere else on your computer.

EX: You are in the directory dental, which is not yet a Git repository. Use a single command to convert it to a Git repository.

---------------

How can I create a copy of an existing repository?
Sometimes you will join a project that is already running, inherit a project from someone else, or continue working on one of your own projects on a new machine. In each case, you will clone an existing repository instead of creating a new one. Cloning a repository does exactly what the name suggests: it creates a copy of an existing repository (including all of its history) in a new directory.

To clone a repository, use the command git clone URL, where URL identifies the repository you want to clone. This will normally be something like

https://github.com/datacamp/project.git
but for this lesson, we will use a repository on the local file system, so you can just use a path to that directory.

When you clone a repository, Git uses the name of the existing repository as the name of the clone's root directory: for example,

git clone /existing/project
will create a new directory called project. If you want to call the clone something else, add the directory name you want to the command:

git clone /existing/project newprojectname

EX: You have just inherited the dental data analysis project from a colleague, who tells you that all of their work is in a repository in /home/thunk/repo. Use a single command to clone this repository to create a new repository called dental inside your home directory (so that the new repository is in /home/repl/dental).
SOLUTION: 

$ pwd
/home/repl
$ ls
$ ls
$ ls /home/thunk/repo
bin  data  report.txt  results
$ git clone /home/thunk/repo dental
Cloning into 'dental'...
done.

----------------

How can I find out where a cloned repository originated?
When you a clone a repository, Git remembers where the original repository was. It does this by storing a remote in the new repository's configuration. A remote is like a browser bookmark with a name and a URL.

If you use an online git repository hosting service like GitHub or Bitbucket, a common task would be that you clone a repository from that site to work locally on your computer. Then the copy on the website is the remote.

If you are in a repository, you can list the names of its remotes using git remote.

If you want more information, you can use git remote -v (for "verbose"), which shows the remote's URLs. Note that "URLs" is plural: it's possible for a remote to have several URLs associated with it for different purposes, though in practice each remote is almost always paired with just one URL.

You are in the dental repository. How many remotes does it have?

------------------

How can I define remotes?
When you clone a repository, Git automatically creates a remote called origin that points to the original repository. You can add more remotes using:

git remote add remote-name URL
and remove existing ones using:

git remote rm remote-name
You can connect any two Git repositories this way, but in practice, you will almost always connect repositories that share some common ancestry.
